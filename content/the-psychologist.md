Summary: Imaginary conversations

Looking over at Steve -- who was having his usual chatty morning,
standing by the window, soaking in the sun -- I wondered if he was
having a good conversation. Was it interesting? He seemed to laugh a
lot, so it must be good. Right? Looking back, I think I envied his
ability to talk to someone at any time. What I didn't envy was that
which allowed him to do so. I considered wandering over and saying hi,
but the politeness in me always stopped me. I'm not sure if I would
ever have had the right timing -- maybe no one would.

The problem with schizophrenic is you never know if you're
interrupting.
