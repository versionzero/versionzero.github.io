Summary: An insane life.

Looking over at Steve, having his usual chatty morning, standing by
the window, soaking in the sun, I wondered if he was having a good
conversation. Was it interesting? He seemed to laugh a lot, so it must
be good. Right? Looking back, I think I must have envied his ability
to talk to someone at any time. What I didn't envy was that which
allowed him to do so. I considered wandering over and saying hi, but
the politness in me always stoped me&mdash;I never knew if I would be
interupting. I'm not sure if I would ever have had the right
timing&mdash;maybe no one would.
