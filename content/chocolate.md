Summary: Life is sweet

*Life is like a box of chocolates*, is what that guy said. What an
idiot&mdash;life is not sweet.

My life began in a small town, as you would expect. I lived through
till my mid twenties, by which time I'd had enough. Not of the town
itself, but of who I was because of it. That's when I moved. It's also
when I began to change. Neither was for the better.

Even after a year in the city, I was still alone and sick for
home. I'd meet a few people, through the occational job, but never
managed to find a lasting bond. Most likely because I never tried hard
enough to cement anything meaningful with them. Worse, each time I
changed jobs, I dropped contact with the people from the last&mdash;as
people often do.

I'd lived in a few places by the time the year mark came. The most
recent of which was off downtown, in what used to be a rough
neighbourhood. It was not exactly gentrified, not yet, but it was
getting closer. It was a single room, with a kitchen on the south
wall, a couple of windows on the east wall and a toilet and shower
combination on north&mdash;in open view of the windows.

I'd done what I could with the place, but the years of misuse still
showed. The once white walls we a pale yellow, like the rim of an
unkept urinal. I'd though to paint them, but that had never managed to
get done.
