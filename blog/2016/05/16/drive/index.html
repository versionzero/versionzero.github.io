    <p>He found himself driving across the prairies&mdash;the road stretching
as far as the eye could see, undulating as the small rises and dips
smoothly rocked the car. He had drifted off, for who knows how
long&mdash;certainly not him. He was driving south and in the far
distance, after where the road disappeared, the mountains rose like
waves in a far off storm terrorizing the deep ocean, where no one
visited.</p>
<p>The mountains looked like the buildings of his downtown, but with
softer edges, where more snow gathered than could be expected of a
high-rise.</p>
<p>He was glad to be away from the city; the noise of life there had
always buzzed in his head like an insect stuck in the vent of a car
heater. He has often wished it would die down, that he would get used
to it; but, instead, it continued unabated: pestering his every moment
awake&mdash;and when he was unlucky, his sleep. He was glad to be
away, but the foreign sight of the mountains in the distance made him
uneasy.</p>
<p>The rise of the mountains seemed at odds with the flat demeanor of the
ground beneath him; the sudden rise evoked a sense of vertigo equaled
by his downward high-rise view. The sight made him uncomfortable, yet
still, he drove on.</p>
<p>A town crept slowly in to view; it too was as foreign as the mountain
ranges that dwarfed it further.</p>
<p>The lull of the road had made him tired. He pulled over at the nearest
gas station and purchased a coffee. After returning to the car he
continued on, unsure of what he would do next, except drive towards
the rocky pillars that lay ahead, beyond the end of the road.</p>
