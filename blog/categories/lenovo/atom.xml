    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The sentiment, &ldquo;I get the LogonUI.exe error after the Windows 10 TP
setup,&rdquo; seems to be common. Fortunately, the solution is very straight
forward if you are on a Lenovo machine.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Here are the steps that worked for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start Windows 10 in Safe-Mode. To do this, press and hold the left
shift key (the one you can use to turn caps lock on)</li>
<li>Once you have booted Windows in to Safe Mode, it is time to apply
the fix:

<ul>
<li>NOTE: The Uninstall tools will not work in Safe Mode. This is
because the Installer Service is not running, nor can it be
started in Safe Mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We use a very simple fix, in that we do nothing more than move the
offending applications out of the way, so they will not be found by
any of the startup processes. On a Lenovo machine, the offending
application&mdash;the fingerprint authentication tool&mdash;resides in
&ldquo;C:\Program Files\Lenovo&rdquo;. Remedying the problem is a simple as moving
the Lenovo directory to the desktop and rebooting</li>
<li>I have yet to replace the Lenovo finger-print application with an
equivalent package, but there seems to be some evidence to suggest
that the Windows 10 biometrics tools can be used on their own</li>
</ol>
