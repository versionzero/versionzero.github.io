    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, through school and other areas, I became addicted to
both Emacs and my Mac. Unfortunately, as both evolved, they became less
and less friendly with each other.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>One thing in particular bothers me about the interaction between Emacs
and a Mac: the keyboard. It used to be I could use Ctrl+Left/Right
arrow to skip an Emacs defined &ldquo;word&rdquo;; however, this became the way
for Mac users to switch spaces. This is when I found Karabiner. I now
use Karabiner to change the purpose of the Fn key so that I can use it
and the arrow keys to switch spaces, but also maintain the ability to
skip around in Emacs by words, instead of simply by character or
paragraph.</p>

<p>Here is my private.xml for this particular use case:</p>

<p><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="ni">&amp;lt;</span>?xml version=<span class="ni">&amp;ldquo;</span>1.0<span class="ni">&amp;rdquo;</span>?&gt;
<span class="nt">&lt;root&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;item&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;name&gt;</span>My Spaces (I like to use Fn+Left/Right arrow for switching spaces)<span class="nt">&lt;/name&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;appendix&gt;</span>Change Fn to Ctrl+Option+Command<span class="nt">&lt;/appendix&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;identifier&gt;</span>private.fn_control_option_command_hyper<span class="nt">&lt;/identifier&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;autogen&gt;&lt;strong&gt;</span>KeyToKey<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> KeyCode::FN, KeyCode::COMMAND_L, ModifierFlag::OPTION_L, ModifierFlag::CONTROL_L<span class="nt">&lt;/autogen&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/item&gt;</span>

code to the site is available, but what follows is code that is
independent of the site, in so far as it doesn&rsquo;t help run it. The code

<h3>Streaming to iOS Devices</h3>

<p>The first question that comes to mind is why? Why would you want to
stream to an iOS device rather than just from it?</p>

<p>The answer reveals how fortunate (spoiled) I&rsquo;ve been over the past few
years: I&rsquo;ve always been a technology enthusiast and I have always been
one to try to keep somewhat up-to-date on the latest gadgets. In some
respects, this has meloed over the years, but it hasn&rsquo;t stopped me
from buying a new previous generation iPhone every time a new one is
released. In this case, it means I am currently an owner of a 5s and
4s, as I have not gotten rid of the 4s yet. This is all relevant
because it lead me to this question: what can I do with an old iPhone
that I might not be able to do with a computer. It turns out, there is
a lot you can use an old iPhone for, much of which is not relevant,
except streaming.</p>

<p>I used my iPhone 4s as a remote and as a Netflix source to stream to
my TVs. The novelty of this quickly wore off, so I started looking
around for other uses. This is when I realized I&rsquo;d like to install it
in my car and stream to it, from another source. I have an iOS dock in
my car. Not one that connects to an existing stereo or cables, but is
instead a stereo designed to hold an iOS device internally (or a USB
drive, etc.). The idea for device reuse or specialized use would be to
allow to stream from one device to another. In my case, one iPhone to
another. This way, the music, etc. is on one device, but the output is
on another. This would make updating music and listening to it on the
car iPhone trivial, as the device would never need to have updated
manually, or if it did, it wouldn&rsquo;t be critical that be sync&rsquo;d every
night or even week. (Yes, a &ldquo;first world problem&rdquo; (FWP), but hey, most
technology fixes FWP these days&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t it? Not many Pinterest users
bragging about the bag of support rice they had dropped on their
head. Or maybe there are.)</p>

<h3>How to Stream</h3>

<p>Since we are writing an open source project, we can use a bunch of
open source libraries and tools. For the base streaming part, I&rsquo;ve
chosen to use <a href="https://github.com/abrasive/shairport">shairport</a>;
unfortunately, it does not support iOS out of the box, so we need to
make some modifications&mdash;which is actually a good thing: otherwise,
we&rsquo;d be done with the writing, right about now.</p>

    <link href="http://versionzero.github.io/blog/2014/12/27/ethical-computing/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-27T22:21:02-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://versionzero.github.io/blog/2014/12/27/ethical-computing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This essay is about performing and consuming computational cycles
ethically. Ethical computing is a means of computing with a focus on
reducing harmful externalities. We shall explore what an ethical
computation could look like from a variety of angles. We then argue
for a variety of means by which we might enable further development in
those areas.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Ethical Computation</h2>

<p>We shall explore each of the following topics in turn:</p>

<ol>
<li>The source of labor for the construction of physical computers</li>
<li>Sources of materials used in the construction of computer hardware</li>
<li>Sources of power used for the creation of computing cycles
(i.e. running the computer hardware)</li>
<li>Consumer, academic, industrial, and business influences on the
in-expense of computing products</li>
</ol>


<p>Later. we shall discus some possible solutions and , including:</p>

<ol>
<li>Frugal computing: the re-purposing of old computer hardware to
offset the costs associated with the disposal as well as powering
the hardware.</li>
</ol>


<p>We will focus on <em>popular</em> account of this issue, rather than a
densely inassesible accademic treatment. Not that we believe this will
lessen the power of the argument; we hope, instead, to make it more
readable and multimedia sourced. Using news articles and video sources
from TEDx, etc. we hope to broaden the audience and impact for this
topic. We believe this more important than the strict rigor of
academia&hellip; for the time being.</p>

<h2>Sources of Labor</h2>

<p>We begin with the human means of production. The party-line tells us
sweatshops are bad, immoral, unethical, torturous, etc.. The opposite
has been argued by
<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/leslie_t_chang_the_voices_of_china_s_workers?language=en">Leslie T. Chang</a>:
According to Chang, the sweatshops can enable upward social,
economic. and educational movement&mdash;even if not in every instance. In
other words, the jobs create a more educated and highly skilled
workforce, and open up new possitions for further future workforce
accention. Clearly, this is not the whole picture: not all workers get
out, not all places are good or even comprehendible places to work;
however, that there exists exceptions is hopeful. It means there are
examples for new companies to sustain cheap labour, without
nessesarily being compromizingly opressive and exploitative&mdash;though
they still might be considered these things, by &ldquo;western&rdquo; standards.</p>

    <link href="http://versionzero.github.io/blog/2014/12/24/logonui.exe-application-error-windows-10/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-24T01:05:02-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://versionzero.github.io/blog/2014/12/24/logonui.exe-application-error-windows-10</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The sentiment, &ldquo;I get the LogonUI.exe error after the Windows 10 TP
setup,&rdquo; seems to be common. Fortunately, the solution is very straight
forward if you are on a Lenovo machine.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Here are the steps that worked for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start Windows 10 in Safe-Mode. To do this, press and hold the left
shift key (the one you can use to turn caps lock on)</li>
<li>Once you have booted Windows in to Safe Mode, it is time to apply
the fix:

<ul>
<li>NOTE: The Uninstall tools will not work in Safe Mode. This is
because the Installer Service is not running, nor can it be
started in Safe Mode</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We use a very simple fix, in that we do nothing more than move the
offending applications out of the way, so they will not be found by
any of the startup processes. On a Lenovo machine, the offending
application&mdash;the fingerprint authentication tool&mdash;resides in
&ldquo;C:\Program Files\Lenovo&rdquo;. Remedying the problem is a simple as moving
the Lenovo directory to the desktop and rebooting</li>
<li>I have yet to replace the Lenovo finger-print application with an
equivalent package, but there seems to be some evidence to suggest
that the Windows 10 biometrics tools can be used on their own</li>
</ol>
