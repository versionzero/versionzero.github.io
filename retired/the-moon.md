Summary: A night in the life of the Moon


The Moon started it's nightly rounds. Rising, as it always did, in the
east and slowly moving westward. This had been it's habit for many
years. How many? It could not remember, but it had been a while. An
astronomically long while, it supposed. The Moon also didn't know why
it had started, nor why the trip&mdash;and it's apparent dedication to
it&mdash;had ever seemed interesting enough to do it for so long.

The Moon took in the sights of the darkened planet bellow. It had not
been that long ago that the surface of the planet had been completely
black. Now, however, the surface was sprinkled with specks of light,
flickering like fireflies in the night.  The lit specks reminded the
Moon of the lights that blanketed the space around the planet.

There was a difference between the lights on the surface and the
lights that surround, the ones on the surface seemed somehow
choreographed in very particular way. It was hard for the Moon to
identify what was particularly peculiar about those on the surface,
but they did seem to differ. For one, the ones on the surface we
clumped more densly than those in the surounding parts. Sure, there
were some clumps in those that suround, but not nearly as dense.

At times some would go out, but always in a group; never, at least as
it appeared to the Moon, individually.
