Summary: Just a drive.

He found himself driving across the prairies&mdash;the road stretching
as far as the eye could see, undulating as the small rises and dips
smoothly rocked the car. He had drifted off, for who knows how
long&mdash;certainly not him. He was driving south and in the far
distance, after where the road disappeared, the mountains rose like
waves in a far off storm terrorizing the deep ocean, where no one
visited.

The mountains looked like the buildings of his downtown, but with
softer edges, where more snow gathered than could be expected of a
high-rise.

He was glad to be away from the city; the noise of life there had
always buzzed in his head like an insect stuck in the vent of a car
heater. He has often wished it would die down, that he would get used
to it; but, instead, it continued unabated: pestering his every moment
awake&mdash;and when he was unlucky, his sleep. He was glad to be
away, but the foreign sight of the mountains in the distance made him
uneasy.

The rise of the mountains seemed at odds with the flat demeanor of the
ground beneath him; the sudden rise evoked a sense of vertigo equaled
by his downward high-rise view. The sight made him uncomfortable, yet
still, he drove on.

A town crept slowly in to view; it too was as foreign as the mountain
ranges that dwarfed it further.

The lull of the road had made him tired. He pulled over at the nearest
gas station and purchased a coffee. After returning to the car he
continued on, unsure of what he would do next, except drive towards
the rocky pillars that lay ahead, beyond the end of the road.
