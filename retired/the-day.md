Summary: One data

The day was rainy, like they usually where in the area. The clouds
hung stationary in the sky, pouring their wares on the ground
bellow. The ground seemed happy with this, especially the prairie
grass, which rose to meet the rain in an embarrassingly eager
way. Had the two been human, one might imagine they were teenagers in
their first encounter. But they weren't, and it wasn't. The dance the
rain and the grass were caught in happened every year, and, in fact,
every opportunity the two had to meet. It had been raining for a week
now.

Micheal opened the door to the barn. The old door, much in need of
repair, swung, dipped, squealed and came to rest half way before it
would be useful. M, as usual, pushed the door the rest of the way. The
door complained eagerly. In the barn was his collection of rust. Most
of the rust was still attached to working machines, but some could be
gathered and displayed with honour. M aimed his sights on an old axe,
hung on a beam under the horseshoe from long dead work mule. He
grabbed the axe and returned to the orgy outside.

Over near the house was a shed with no walls. In it were pilles of,
hopefully, dry logs. Beside the shed was the stump of an old tree. M
remembered climbing the tree with his brother during the summers of
his youth. Those days were a long time ago now, but the memory of it
gave the impression that it was yesterday. So much was the illusion,
that M imagined his mother on the verge of exiting the house with a
pitcher of iced tea. The day he imagined was, of course, not a rainy
one. But that should be clear.

The old stump had been worn down by repeated axe hits, so M had carved
out a nook where he could place a fresh log every time he wanted to
chop a new batch of fire wood. The house had central heating by that
point, so there was little need for a fire, but the crackle and the
smoke reminded M of the past, in the same way the stump had.

M began the laborious job of chopping up logs in to smaller chunks
that better fit in a fireplace and better burnt when lit. His father
used to do this work. One time his father was forced to do this at
night in the cold: the dry soulless cold that only the prairies
know. M remembered this night vividly. In his mind, M, stood over the
table where his mother was working on his fathers leg. The lamp he was
using had gone out during the work of cutting wood, and in a
panic--not the language his father would have used--his father had
missed the log and swung the axe in to his own leg. His father was
never very much the same. Not because he walked with a limp, that was
expected; but because his own imagined heavy shame of being so
careless.

M loaded fireplace with wood and lit it. In the past, M's family had
sat around the fire in the evenings and discussed the goings on of the
day. M liked the stories his grandmother told. The ones about other
countries, where people behaved almost like he did, but in subtly
different and strange ways. But everyone was especially interested in
the news of the war. His brother had been in the war.
