  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous post, I started ruminating on the prospect of outfitting
my (then) new car with a GPS and On-Board-Diagnostic II (herein ODB2)
logger machine.</p>

<p>At the time, I didn&rsquo;t know much about GPS, ODB2, or even cars, for
that matter.  It&rsquo;s now ten months later, and I still know very little
about them, except I did learn enough to change the way I first
approached the design of the logger machine.</p>

<p>My first mistake, though you could not have convinced me of it at the
time, was to not do an extensive survey of all GPS and ODB2 software
packages for Linux.  Instead, having looked at only a handful, I
picked a few packages that, while effective, were hard to use,
troubleshoot and maintain.  (This is not entirely true, it was mostly
the ODB2 packages that left much to be desired.)  Ten months has shown
me that a few more weeks of searching would have saved me 7-8 months
of frustration.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there&ndash;so we won&rsquo;t dwell on it. Well, not
too much.</p>

<p>I recently had a few weeks leave from my day job(s?), and the part of
the intractable boredom of being free of any responsibility to
anything or anyone, revitalized my interest in this so called logger
machine.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to take a much closer look at the available
tools and put more effort into choosing the appropriate ones from the
start. I&rsquo;m happy to say that the extra effort was not exerted in vain.
I found a single tool (package?) that performs all the required
functions.</p>

<p>To be brief on the subject of research, I ran across an almost
tailor-made-for-use-case project named, appropriately enough, &ldquo;OBD GPS
Logger&rdquo; or obdgpslogger for short(er).  I am not sure how I missed it
the first time through&hellip; I may have seen the screenshots of some of
its tools and figured it was all graphically driven.  Anyway, what it
does, simply, is periodically gather OBD data, GPS location data and a
time-stamp.  With this information, it is a simple matter to examine
where and when particular events in a vehicle take effect.  More
interestingly, the data may help inform my future driving, by allowing
me to identify weak points in my habits.  Whether or not I&rsquo;ll change
my driving habits is an entirely different discussion.</p>

<p>The obdgpslogger package was almost perfectly tailored to my use case.
Unfortunately, because of architectural changes in its dependencies,
it would not compile.  There were three possible solutions to this:
(1) return to not bothering with the project, (2) remove all the
pre-packaged and installed dependencies and install ones compatible
with the available version of obdgpslogger, or (3) update the
obdgpslogger code-base to support the new API exposed by its
dependencies.</p>

<p>At this point, (1) wasn&rsquo;t really a consideration, since I&rsquo;d just begun
working on the project, and still retained some interest in its
completion.  Of course (2) would be a reasonable compromise between
having a functioning prototype and an out-of-date set of dependencies
that may break other software packages, contain bugs that have only
recently been addressed, and so on.  Still, it would have been a
working solution, so I did not dismiss it entirely.  That is, not
until I found that (3) only required a few trivial changes.  This
established (3) as my approach; though the approach was also slightly
coloured by my desire to write new code, even if it was just a few
lines.</p>

<p>With that decision made, it was a simple matter getting the original
code, creating a public fork, and addressing every compilation error
as they occurred.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I made the mistake, when I started using revision control&mdash;like many
others might have done&mdash;to think of it, conceptually, as a backup
mechanism. This, it turns out, I believe, is naive, and a very poor
characterization of the power of revision control. Let me explain.</p>

ethically. Ethical computing is a means of computing with a focus on
reducing harmful externalities. We shall explore what an ethical

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I very rarely know what I want.  Sometimes
this is because there are too many choices and I can&rsquo;t make up my
mind.  Other times, it&rsquo;s because I am genuinely too ignorant to know a
good thing when I see it.</p>

<p>This all happend sometime after my teenage years. At least then, in
spite of knowing less than I do now, I knew exactly what I wanted.
Actually, I should qualify that: I strongly (arrogantly?) believed I
knew what I wanted, because I knew <em>everything</em>. I miss the confidence
of youth.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is not a post about the constant uncertainty of adult
life.  There are plenty of those around to last us well in to the
introduction of the next species.</p>

<p>This post is about designing from what you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Part of my yet un-finished graduate work involved using a combination
of threading and cache-oblivious algorithms to improve the performance
of various linear algebra computations on sparse data sets.  During
the course of my work, I used a few concurrency models, including
Intel&rsquo;s <a href="http://cilkplus.org">Cilk Plus</a> data and task parallelism
techniques.</p>

<p>Recently, the <a href="http://cilkplus.github.com">Cilk Plus language extensions were introduced to the Clang frontend for LLVM</a>.  Which mean it
was available on Darwin.  Though the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/branches/cilkplus/">Cilk Plus extensions and runtime have been available in GCC</a> for some time,
building the GCC code on Darwin proved to be non-trivial. (For me, at
least&mdash; the Linux build was far easier.)  The introduction of Cilk
Plus in Clang allows for easy compilation and use on the Darwin
platform.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since I purchased my latest vehicle, I&rsquo;ve been working on a
little side project to interface directly with the vehicle&rsquo;s on-board
computer.</p>

<p>The task itself is pretty straight forward: buy device capable of
plugging in to the vehicle&rsquo;s ODB2 port, and run some free or
inexpensive Android app to gather the information.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the above process requires a great deal of user
intervention.  First, you must always plug and unplug the ODB2 device.
Second, you must either have an Android device on your person or in
the vehicle capable of running the required software or a computer
with a variety of command-line tools installed.  The latter is
impractical, and the former is error prone (I&rsquo;ll forget to start the
app, take the readings, etc.) and tedious (The data must later be
extracted from the app manually, or a web-service must be made
available to push the data to&ndash; which also requires a data plan, if
the car is not always in the proximity of a wifi access point).</p>

<p>Raspberry Pi to the rescue.</p>
